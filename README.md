# The most exciting minesweeper version on your terminal

This repository contains a version of the game *the minesweeper*.
Some lessons at University were really boring that we started playing the version installed by default on our linux version.
Once we mastered it, we came up with the idea of developing our own version of the game.
The project was thought to be the fisrt step of a bigger that we wanted to carry on setting up a graphic user interface and then training an AI able to win efficiently the board.
Unfortunately we are stuck at the first step (you know, exams at University, other projects going on...). 
If you want to contribuite with some new stuff feel totally free to contact us or to fork something good.
If you just want to play the game instead, clone or download this repository and run **python game.py** on your command line.
Enjoy getting blown :3
